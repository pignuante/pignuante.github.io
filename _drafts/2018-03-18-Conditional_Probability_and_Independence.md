## 1.4 Conditional Probability and Independence

Conditional probability of $$C_2$$ given $$C_1$$ is
$$
\begin{aligned}
	P\left(C_2|C_1\right) = \frac{P\left(C_2\cap C_1\right)}{P\left(C_1\right)}, \quad C_1\lt C_2 \lt \mathscr{C}
\end{aligned}
$$

1. $$P\left(C_2|C_2\right)\ge0$$ (Non-negative)
2. $$P\left(C_1|C_1\right)=0$$ (Normality)
3. $$P\left(\cup_{i=2}^{\infty}C_i|C_1\right)=\sum_{i=2}^{\infty} P\left(C_i|C_1\right), \quad C_2, C_3,\cdots \text{are mutually exclusive}$$. (Countable Additivity)

> **ex 1.4.3)** Consider drawing cards successively at random and without replacement. Find the probability that the *3rd* spade appears on the *6th* draw.
