# 1. Probability & Distribution



## 1.1 Introduction

#### Definition

1. Statistical(random) experiment.
   - The outcome can not be predicted with certainly prior to the performance of experiment.
2. Sample space.
   - Collection of every possible outcome from the random[^1] experiment and denoted $$\mathscr{C}$$.
3. Event.
   - Subset of `Sample space` and denoted by A, B, C$$\cdots$$.

> ex 1.1) Consider tossing a coin, 
> ​	then $$\mathscr{C}=\left\{\text{H, T}\right\}$$.
>
> ex 1.2) Consider tossing two dice(one red, the other white),
> ​	then $$\mathscr{C}=\left\{\left(1, 1\right)\cdots\left(6,6\right)\right\}$$
>
> ex 1.3) Consider sum seven when tossing two dice,
>
> ​	then $$\mathscr{C}=\left\{\left(1, 6\right), \left(2, 5\right), \cdots \left(6, 1\right)\right\}$$



#### Remark 1.1

Two types of probability.

1. Relative Frequency[^2].
2. Personal[^3].

## 1.2 Set Theory

#### Definition 1.2.1

- If each element of set $$C_1$$ is also an element of set $$C_2$$, then $$C_1$$ is called **subset** of $$C_2$$, and denoted by $$C_1\subset C_2$$.

#### Definition 1.2.2

- If a set C has no elements, tehn C is called the **NULL**(empty) set, and denoted by $$C=\varnothing$$.

#### Definition 1.2.3

- The set of all elements that belong to at least $$C_1$$ or $$C_2$$ is called the **union** of $$C_1$$ and $$C_2$$, and denoted by $$C_1\cup C_2$$.
- It can be generalized to any number of sets $$C_1\cup C_2 \cup \cdots : =\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty C_k$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
	C_k = & \left\{x:\frac{1}{k+1}\le x\le1\right\},\quad k=1,2,3,\cdots \\
	\Rightarrow	& \bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}C_k = \left\{x: 0 \lt x\le 1\right\}
\end{aligned}
